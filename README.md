Java StandAlone Application that has 3 different layers

  1 Application Layer
  2 Control Layer and
  3 Data Layer

Application layer is used for user interacation
Data layer is used for handling of data and users can not directly communicate with the data layer
Control layer communicates between the application and the data layers
This ensures a secure way of handling the data

An interface is used which defines the working of the control layer
